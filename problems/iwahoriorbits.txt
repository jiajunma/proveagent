# Classification of Iwahori orbits on \(V\)

## Setup

Let \(F\) be a non-archimedean local field with ring of integers \(\mathfrak{O}\) and uniformizer \(\varpi\). Let \(V\)  be finite-dimensional vector spaces over \(F\) with dimension $n$ and standard basis \(e_1, ..., e_n\). Fix the Iwahori subgroup I$ consists of elements sending $e_i$ to the lattice $\sum_{j<= i} \mathfrak{O}e_j + \sum_{j>i}\varphi \mathfrak{O} e_j$


**Classify the orbits of the Iwahori action on \(V\).**

That is, describe a complete set of representatives for the orbit space
\[
I  \backslash V 
\]
in terms of some combinatorial data
